# Jarek - The Desktop Assistant
Well, Hi there!! This is your personal desktop assistant -Jarek. So, many of you will ask "Yeah there are a lots of Desktop Assitants or Virtual Assistants. What's new?" So, Let me explain you.

# The program is in the release tab bcoz GitHub doesn't support files larger than 25 mb.

Contact - Discord DM me at @Kamal/Legend#8821

# What's Different :-
# I. Settings Window
# I. (a) Music and Voice
So, there's a settings window which can be used to turn off the music or change the voice of the assistant i.e. Male or Female.
# I. (b) Manage Website
And yes there's a "Manage Website" button which can be used to add website commands, see all the existings website commands and edit the existing website commands.
# I. (c) Manage Files that can be opened
And there is a "Manage Files that can be opened" command. Where you can see what files can open, add files, edit files that can be opened.
# I. (d) Myths about the Settings window and it's feature
So the majority I mean litreally majority of you would be like. Yeah it will work when the command is added but will not work when the window is exited and entered again. But no my man, it's not that thing. This will save your program everytime you added or change something.
# II. How did I did the saving state feature
See, I don't won't to disclose this trick. Coz I litreally got it in a week. But yeah I can give you a hint. I used files. I won't say anything else.
# III. Jarek - The desktop Assistant
Finally, yes. So I used a ton of complex codes to handle and I won't say anything about it. Just download the folder and open the executable file. Then click virtual assistant button and write '\commands' to get the commands and '\about' to get the about page.
# IV. Tools and sources
Every module I used is in Requirements.txt. Go check it out
# BTW my Jarek is pretty smart. It may rick roll you so see.
